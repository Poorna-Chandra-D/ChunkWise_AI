## 💡 About

ChunkWise AI is an intelligent chatbot system that transforms large documents into searchable, semantically meaningful chunks using **LangChain**, **FAISS**, and **OpenAI**. It retrieves only the most relevant information, delivering fast and precise answers with minimal token usage.

**The problem it solves:**
- ❌ Manual copy-paste of long articles is painful and tedious
- ❌ Most models choke beyond ~3,000 words
- ❌ You often need just the right chunk, not the entire article

**The solution:**
- ✅ Automatically ingest documents and web articles
- ✅ Semantically split, embed, and index content
- ✅ Retrieve only what matters and generate focused answers

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
📄 Load Documents
      ↓
✂️  Chunk & Split (RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter)
      ↓
🔢 Embed (OpenAI Embeddings → Vectors)
      ↓
💾 Store in Vector DB (FAISS Index)
      ↓
🔍 Retrieve relevant chunks (Semantic Search)
      ↓
🤖 Generate answer (OpenAI LLM)
      ↓
💬 Display in Streamlit UI

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- An [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)

### Installation

**1. Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Poorna-Chandra-D/ChunkWise_AI.git
cd ChunkWise_AI
```

**2. Install dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configure your API key**

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## 📖 Usage

**Start the application:**

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

**Then follow these steps:**

1. 🌐 **Enter URLs** — Paste up to 3 article URLs in the sidebar
2. ▶️ **Process** — Click **"Process URLs"** to load, split, embed, and index the content
3. ❓ **Ask Questions** — Type your question in the main area and get contextual answers with sources

## 🔬 Architecture Deep Dive

### 1. Document Loading & Chunking

Documents are loaded via `UnstructuredURLLoader` and split using `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`, which intelligently breaks text by:

**Paragraphs → Sentences → Words → Characters**

This keeps each chunk within token limits while preserving context.

### 2. Embeddings & Vector Storage

Text chunks are transformed into numerical vectors using **OpenAI Embeddings**. These vectors capture semantic meaning — so *"iPhone review"* and *"Apple product feedback"* end up close together in vector space.

Vectors are indexed using **FAISS** for instant similarity search.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

When you ask a question:
1. Your query is converted into a vector
2. FAISS finds the most semantically similar chunks
3. Only those chunks are sent to the LLM
4. The LLM generates a focused, cost-efficient answer
