# ChunkWise_AI
ChunkWise AI is an intelligent chatbot system that transforms large documents into searchable, semantically meaningful chunks using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI. It finds and retrieves only the most relevant information, delivering fast, precise answers with minimal token usage — making knowledge more accessible, efficient, and scalable.

Day 1 of the project.

Tired of Copy-Pasting Articles into ChatGPT? So was I.

Ever found yourself copying long articles into ChatGPT just to get fragmented responses or hit token limits?
I’ve been there—it's tedious, inefficient, and not scalable.

🔍 The issues:

Manual copy-paste is painful.

Most models choke beyond ~3000 words.

We often need just the right chunk, not the whole article.

So I started building a solution:
An AI assistant that reads, understands, and responds based on semantically relevant chunks using Langchain, FAISS, and OpenAI.

Stay tuned. In this mini-series, I’ll walk you through the entire dev journey—from ingestion to chat UI.

Day2 of the project.

🚀 What Powers an Intelligent Chatbot? Let’s Break It Down.

When you ask an AI a smart question, there’s an entire hidden engine working behind the scenes.

For my project, I designed a simple but powerful AI knowledge engine made of these moving parts:

🔹 Load Documents → Bring in raw content
🔹 Chunk & Split → Break it into smaller, meaningful pieces
🔹 Embed → Turn those pieces into numbers (vectors!)
🔹 Vector Store (FAISS) → Save them smartly for lightning-fast search
🔹 Retriever → Grab only the relevant chunks for your question
🔹 LLM (OpenAI) → Generate a focused, clear answer
🔹 Chatbot UI (React/Streamlit) → Show you the final magic 💬

Every piece has a reason.
Without proper chunking, we overfeed the LLM.
Without semantic search, answers become random.

Tomorrow, I’ll dive deeper into how we split and embed documents like a pro.

👀 Here’s the roadmap visual for today—makes it way easier to understand 👇
