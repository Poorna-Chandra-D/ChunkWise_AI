# ChunkWise_AI
ChunkWise AI is an intelligent chatbot system that transforms large documents into searchable, semantically meaningful chunks using LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI. It finds and retrieves only the most relevant information, delivering fast, precise answers with minimal token usage ‚Äî making knowledge more accessible, efficient, and scalable.

Day 1 of the project.

Tired of Copy-Pasting Articles into ChatGPT? So was I.

Ever found yourself copying long articles into ChatGPT just to get fragmented responses or hit token limits?
I‚Äôve been there‚Äîit's tedious, inefficient, and not scalable.

üîç The issues:

Manual copy-paste is painful.

Most models choke beyond ~3000 words.

We often need just the right chunk, not the whole article.

So I started building a solution:
An AI assistant that reads, understands, and responds based on semantically relevant chunks using Langchain, FAISS, and OpenAI.

Stay tuned. In this mini-series, I‚Äôll walk you through the entire dev journey‚Äîfrom ingestion to chat UI.
